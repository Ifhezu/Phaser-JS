# Phasar JS 1
Phaser Loading and Menu Screen Example showcasing a PhaserJS application with a loading screen and a menu screen, includes proper asset preloading and seamless scene transitions in PhaserJS. Once the assets are loaded, the app smoothly transitions to a user-friendly menu screen.

Please note that you need "phaser.min.js" to run it which I haven't included here since we can just download it from the relevant website.
